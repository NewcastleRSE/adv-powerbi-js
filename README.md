### Testing the Visual


### Compiling the Visual
Open PowerShell and navigate to the visual's folder. Then run:

`pbiviz package`

This will create a .pbiviz file in the dist folder, which can then be imported into Power BI Desktop.

### More Instructions
For more information (including diagrams, screenshots and examples), there is a full tutorial [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/visuals/custom-visual-develop-tutorial). Part One includes testing instructions and Part Two contains compling instructions.
